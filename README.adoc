= Curriculum Vitae

This is an in-progress document.

Herein lies a comprehensive document which details my skills, education, experience, and accomplishments. I am writing this to be as exhaustive as is useful to me (which is what I typically think of as a CV; regionally, a CV can be more brief.)

== Building with Asciidoc

There is a build script in ./bin if you care to peruse this. You will need to install asciidoctor first; I make no attempt to manage that dependency in this repository.

== Why Asciidoc?

Asciidocs are simple to write and produce nice results. I prefer writing plain-text asciidoc files to working in Libre or Word when possible, since while those tools are powerful, they're also overcomplicated for the majority of my needs.
