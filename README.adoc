== Building with Asciidoctor

1. Install asciidoctor
2. Compile with `bin/build.sh` or manually with `asciidoctor root.adoc` or `asciidoctor-pdf root.adoc` if you have the pdf extension.

== Why Asciidoc?

Asciidocs are simple to write and produce nice results. I prefer writing plain-text asciidoc files to working in Libre or Word when possible, since while those tools are powerful, they're also overcomplicated for the majority of my needs. Plus, this is easy to version-control and _very_ easy to organize!
