= Virginia Wesleyan College (VWC), Norfolk, VA, USA
[.lead]
B.S. Mathematics, B.S. Computer Science. Minor Psychology.

I graduated from VWC _summa cum laude_ in May 2016 with a 3.98/4.00 GPA, as a Wesleyan Scholar, and first in the natural sciences and mathematics division. _VWC acknowledges class leaders during graduation ceremonies, but for whatever reason does not otherwise disclose rank. I held a flag, though! Honest!_

(This institution is now Virginia Wesleyan University, VWU.)
